If you want “less hardcoded, more dynamic,” the next best steps are:

Move constants (location, TTLs, polling intervals, command triggers) into a settings.json in memory and load it at runtime.
Create a command registry (index.ts) so handlers self‑register and you can enable/disable via config.
Add a “profile” loader that reads personal data into a structured object (name, weight, location) and uses it to drive weather/timezone.
Add model routing config (fast/quality) in settings so it’s not hardwired in code.
Make prompt sections dynamic: include only data keys that match the query (e.g., if asking about weight, include just weight).
If you want, I can draft a simple settings.json schema and wire it into the worker.
